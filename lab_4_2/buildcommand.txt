Serial Wire Debug (SWD)
Edit this on GitHub

Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a two-pin interface (SWDIO and SWCLK) alternative to the JTAG four- or five-pin debugging interface standard.

Uploading new programs to your Pico
The Pico Debug Probe will let you load binaries via the SWD port and OpenOCD: you will not need to unplug, and then push-and-hold, the BOOTSEL button every time you push a new binary to your Pico. Using the Debug Probe uploading new binaries is an entirely hands off affair.

Once you have built a binary:

# For writing .elf to pico with openOCD
add_custom_command(
    TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME}
    POST_BUILD
    COMMAND openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program $<TARGET_FILE:${PROJECT_NAME}> verify reset exit"
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}
    COMMENT "Programming the target using OpenOCD"
)

#e.g. it works also
# sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program build/lab_4.elf verify reset exit"

with some DEPENDS, but it worked without
# Add a custom target for programming using OpenOCD
add_custom_target(program
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Programming with OpenOCD..."
    COMMAND openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/build/${PROJECT_NAME}.elf verify reset exit"
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Programming complete."
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}
    COMMENT "Programming the target using OpenOCD"
    DEPENDS ${PROJECT_NAME} # Add this line to specify the dependency
